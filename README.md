# Mini Shell

The purpose of this project is to implement your own customized minified shell that performs system calls similar to bash.

This involves executing all input commands entered by user and return expected results.

It forks and execs calls to create new processess to perform operations in parallel and also to pipeline execution.

It also creates deamon processes that executes in background and return results after completion.

There is a provision to bring background process to foreground and visa-versa. Also you can assign a process to a particular group and 

later can kill the group if needed. This will kill all the processes of that group.
